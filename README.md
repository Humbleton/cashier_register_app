CASHBOX REGISTER
The idea was to create a program that would allow the cashier to give back adequate changes to customers.
THE function returns the amount of notes and coins for the customer's change.
Example: If the price is 3.75 and the paid amount is 50, then the client receives â‚¬46.25 back in change.
